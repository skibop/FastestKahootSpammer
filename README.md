This is a brute force Kahoot Spammer, the fastest one on Github, or on the internet. This will continue to be updated after I post this on github.
To run this program, you must have python installed. 

Steps And Installation:

- Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/, hit the download button and follow the steps prompted, and you will have python installed!
-  After that, in command prompt type "pip install kahootpy", and let the module install. 
-  After this is complete, you are set to go! 
-  Lastly, run the python file and you will be prompted for the Code, and the name of the bots that you want to use. When you see the console printing out information about the bots joining, it means that the bots are successfully joining the kahoot lobby!
-  If you so choose to take out the bots in a middle of the process, simply close out of the program that prints out the information about the bots joining the kahoot.
-  Please be aware that whatever amount of number bots you choose, will not result in the exact number of bots in the lobby, rather it will be around 5 or 6 times as much. It is suggested you keep the bot amount at 100.


Please be responsibile, do not try to aggravate many people!
I am not responsibile for anything you do with this tool, so use at your own risk.
