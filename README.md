To run this program, you must have python installed.

-  After this is complete, you are set to go! 
-  Lastly, update your config.json file with the bot amount, GameID, and desired name of the bots! Please be aware that the amount of bots that you put, will not be that in the lobby. It will go on and on, it is suggeseted that if you want to send a lot of bots you set is 88, for max effiency and less performance issues. Then simply double click on the script.py file, or run it in the terminal, and the bots will rush into the lobby! 
-  If you so choose to take out the bots in a middle of the process, simply close out of the program that prints out the information about the bots joining the kahoot.
